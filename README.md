## Riyadh Metro Ticketing System
The idea of my application is to allow you to book your metro tickets online and be able to manage all your tickets.
First you’ll have to become a member in order to book your online tickets.
After that, you fill your route details by selecting the source and destination of your desired route.

All of that with only 25 saudi riyals!

You are now ready to take the metro any time of the day, all you need to do is to scan the QR code at the metro station. And you’re good to go.

The website also allows you to purchase any of the available tours that the metro can take you through.
Simply add any of your preferred tours to your cart and complete the payment process.
